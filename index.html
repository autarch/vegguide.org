<p>
VegGuide.org has been shut down. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to
the site as well as to all of our nonprofit partners! So long and thanks for
all the mock fish.
</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.happycow.net/">Check out HappyCow</a>. They have
worldwide restaurant and shopping listings, as well as lots of other
information.
</p>

<p>
You might also find <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>
helpful. Try searching for "vegan food near me". And also check
out <a href="https://yelp.com/">Yelp</a> for restaurant listings and reviews.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>
VegGuide was created back in 2002 to fill what I
(<a href="https://blog.urth.org/">Dave Rolsky</a>, the site creator) and
several others saw as a gap in online services. There were also some other
motivations you can
<a href="/philosophy.html">read about in greater detail if you're
interested</a>.
</p>

<p>
The site did get some traction and did have quite a bit usage, particularly
from 2008-2015, when the bulk of the entries currently on the site were added.
</p>

<p>
However, traffic to the site was declining for many years by the time it was
shut down in late 2019. <strong>But even more importantly, contributions to
the site had also declined, so the data on the site was becoming increasingly
stale and out of date. My feeling is that the site was that the site had
become a net negative because it often directed people to businesses that no
longer exist.</strong> This is especially true outside of North America, but
even in North America most of the listings were old and not well-maintained.
</p>

<p>
I think there are a number of factors that led to VegGuide becoming much less
relevant.
</p>

<p>
Probably first and foremost is the rise of mobile devices and apps. A huge
amount of people's internet activity has moved to their phones and apps. We
never had a full-featured app and we didn't have a mobile-friendly web design,
all of which certainly hurt usage quite a bit.
</p>

<p>
In addition, very well-funded commercial entities like Yelp and Google Maps
have done a better and better job of serving the same niche that VegGuide.org
served. When traveling over the last few years I've found Google Maps to be
quite helpful in finding vegan food, and I turned to it before VegGuide or
HappyCow more and more.
</p>

<p>
My own increasingly limited interest in working on the code behind the site
didn't help either. The code base used some technologies that I developed in
the late 1990s and early 2000s. I really started hating to deal with those
technology choices over time, but switching off them was quite
difficult. Also, as I've aged I've also noted that my stamina for working on
large volunteer coding projects by myself has greatly waned. I still enjoy
working on hobby projects, but I'm much better at completing smaller
efforts. Moving VegGuide to a modern technical footing was one of those big
projects I just couldn't get done.
</p>

<p>
That all said, I think it had a good run, I'm proud of what the site
accomplished, and I think creating it was a net good for animals and the
movement.

<h2>Technical Jibber Jabber About Why</h2>

<p>
I <a href="https://blog.urth.org/2019/11/03/on-shutting-down-vegguide-org/">wrote
about the shutdown on my blog</a>, with a lot more technical detail, if that's
something you're interested in.
